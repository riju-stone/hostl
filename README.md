A simple deployment & hosting service/platform - kinda like Vercel

# why
Remember when Vercel openly admitted, they're basically just an AWS wrapper with some additional (although interesting) features. You can find their blog post [right here](https://vercel.com/blog/behind-the-scenes-of-vercels-infrastructure)

This project exists mainly to reduce the dependency on AWS as much as possible (not entirely however), taking advantage of some other open source projects to bring together a solid, yet simple platform for deployments which by the way can be self-hosted itself by anyone! All hail privacy!!

# how
Let the chef cook!
